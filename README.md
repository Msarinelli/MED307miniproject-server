# MED307miniproject-client

Hello and welcome to our miniproject. Our team has developed a messenger application, where one is able to host a chat server and connect with friends. It is possible to write with eachother through the application. Below you will find a guide on, how you can host the server and connect to it.

1. Download MED307miniproject-server and open the folder using Intellij.
2. Run Server.java (This will run the server on your IPv4 address).
3. Download MED307miniproject-client and open the folder using Intellij.
4. Run Client.java.
5. Insert the IPv4 address of the one hosting the server and choose a username. The IPv4 address can be found on the host's machine if you open command prompt on your machine and enter "ipconfig". From there you can see the IPv4 address.
6. Press the "Connect" button and you are in.

Now you can start chatting with other people who are connected to the server. Make sure that you are all on the same internet, otherwise it wont work, unless the ip address it portforwarded.
